## About

This repository is meant to maintain a template for the [Clinical Dataset Structure](https://github.com/AI-READI/cds-specification).


## Structure of this repository
Each version of the CDS template are stored in a dedicated folder under the `versions` folder. An assessment of the compliance of the CSD with the relevant FAIR principles is also included with each version. The `main` folder contain a copy of the latest released version where edits/suggestions can be made via pull request. At the time of the release of a new version of the CDS template, the version in the `main` folder will be copied in the `versions` folder and renamed after the new version number. In addition, a GitHub release willl be made with a zip of the new template. This zip will be also archived on Zenodo. Changes between the different versions are tracked in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file.
